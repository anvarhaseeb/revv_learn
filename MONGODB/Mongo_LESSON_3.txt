	LESSON 3. Indexing and Performance â€“ 6th December
  
        Learn about indexes and their impact on performance.
        Practice creating single-field, compound, and text indexes.
        Explore tools for query performance analysis.
		
		
	extra:
		- To find the executiontime and stats:
			db.cars.find({Make:'Ford'}).explain("executionStats")
		
		- To creating index :
			db.cars.createIndex({Make:1})
		
		- To get the indexes of Collection : 
			db.cars.getIndexes()
			[
			  { v: 2, key: { _id: 1 }, name: '_id_' },
			  { v: 2, key: { Make: 1 }, name: 'Make_1' }
			]
		- To use text index to search:
			db.cars.createIndex({ Make: "text" })
			//Make_text index created
			db.cars.find({ $text: { $search: "Ford" } })
		
		- To drop index:
			db.cars.dropIndex("Make_1")
		
		- To create Index in MongoDB compass: 
			1.go to index tab
			2.Click Create index
			3.Select field and and type
			
		- stage: 'COLLSCAN',means no index used and IXSCAN means index used

		Indexes: Indexes in MongoDB are special data structures that store a portion of the data 
				 in a collection, enabling faster retrieval of documents.
				 Without an index, MongoDB performs a collection scan, checking every document.
